## importSubscriperIPs.pl ##

This script is required by the ipSubscriptions plugin.

The ipSubscriptions plugin allows CRKN authentication bypass. The plugin looks
at the incoming IP of the visitor, checks the crkn_ips table in the OJS
database, and grants access if the visitor is a CRKN subscriber. 

The crkn_ips table must be updated regularly. Install the importSubscriberIPs.pl
script as a cron job, e.g., 
  
0 5 * * Sun /usr/bin/perl [ojs-source]/ipSubscriptions/importSubscriberIPs.pl
