## importSubscriperIPs.pl ##

This script is required by the ipSubscriptions plugin.

The ipSubscriptions plugin allows CRKN authentication bypass. The plugin looks
at the incoming IP of the visitor, checks the crkn_ips table in the OJS
database, and grants access if the visitor is a CRKN subscriber. 

The crkn_ips table must be updated regularly. The script is currently installed
as a nightly cron job in /etc/cron.d/ojs and logs to /var/log/ojs/crkn.log.
