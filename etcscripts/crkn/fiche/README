CRKN harvests journal content from an OAI dissemination of Erudit-encoded
metadata.  This README describes how we used to provide CRKN with journals,
before the OAI service was implemented.

1.  Journal editor identifies new journal issues to be included in the submission
    to Erudit.

2.  Journals are copied from [journals-dir] into a new directory that mirrors
    the structure.  Only XML/ subdirectories are included. We do not submit HTML
    or PDF galleys.  E.g., if the following issue

    [journals-dir]/ACADIENSIS/2009/Vol_38/No_02/

    is being submitted, the followin directory would be created:

    [crkn-dir]/ACADIENSIS/2009/Vol_38/No_02/XML

    with XML copied into the new directory.
    
      (NOTE: Brian determined a way to move content over using rsync:
    
      rsync -am --include="XML/*.xml" --include="*/" --exclude="*" ACADIENSIS/2012/ ~/tmp/

      which means:

      -a = “archive” which means it copies everything recursively and retains things like user/group, 
      etc (it’s an alias for: -rlptgoD)
      -m = prune empty dirs (so we don’t get a bunch of other empty dirs with our xml dir)

      —include=“XML/*.xml” = that’s the stuff you want
      —include=“*/“ = don’t miss dirs that might have the XML dir in it
      —exclude=“*” = exclude everything else

      then a SOURCE and DESTINATION.

      The only downside is that the destination won’t have the “ACADIENSIS/2012/“ it will 
      start with “Vol_” whatever.)

3.  From [crkn-dir], run Perl script called 'buildFicheFile'.  It accepts the
    path to an XML file as an argument.  Run the script as part of a find command:

    find . -name "*.xml" -exec perl /usr/local/bin/buildFicheFile {} \;

4.  The Perl scripts creates a file in the XML directory for each article to be
    sent to CRKN, with a Fiche.xml extension. E.g., for an article file named

    acad38_2art01.xml

    the script would create a corresponding

    acad38_2art01Fiche.xml

5.  Tar or zip up the [crkn-dir] directory and make it available for download by Erudit.
