The ipSubscriptions plugin allows CRKN authentication bypass. The plugin looks
at the incoming IP of the visitor, checks the crkn_ips table in the OJS
database, and grants access if the visitor is a CRKN subscriber. 

The crkn_ips table must be updated regularly. See related script in the
ETC-specific scripts directory:
  
[ojs-source]/etcscripts/crkn/importSubscriberIPs.pl

Install the script as a cron job, e.g., 

0 5 * * Sun /usr/bin/perl [ojs-source]/ipSubscriptions/importSubscriberIPs.pl
